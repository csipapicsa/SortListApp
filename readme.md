# **SortList**
*A dead-simple tool for sorting messy lists — built for academics, researchers, and anyone who works with unordered text.*

## 🚀 What is SortList?
**SortList** is a lightweight Streamlit app that cleans and sorts any list you paste into it.  
No Excel wrangling, no scripting, no headaches — just clean, organized lists in seconds.

Whether you’re in **academia**, **research**, **data analysis**, **grant writing**, **systematic reviews**, or anything where you copy-paste chaotic lists… this saves you time (and sanity).

## ✨ Features
- **Automatic separator detection**  
  Understands commas, semicolons, spaces, and new lines.

- **Custom separators**  
  For unusual formats or dataset-specific delimiters.

- **Whitespace trimming**  
  Removes extra spaces automatically.

- **Duplicate removal**  
  With smart case-insensitive handling.

- **Flexible sorting**  
  Ascending (A→Z) or descending (Z→A), with optional case sensitivity.

- **Multiple export formats**  
  Copy results as:
  - CSV  
  - Semicolon-separated  
  - Quoted items  

- **Clean two-column layout**  
  Input on the left, output on the right — zero confusion.

## 🎯 Why SortList?
Because academics constantly need to sort or clean:
- Author lists  
- Keywords  
- In- and exclusion lists  
- ROI names  
- Questionnaire items  
- Participant IDs  
- Notes from meetings or classes  
- CSV components  
- Search terms for systematic reviews  

Doing that manually is boring and error-prone.  
SortList handles it instantly.

## 🧠 Intended Audience
- Researchers  
- PhD students  
- Systematic review teams  
- Lab managers  
- Data analysts  
- Students  
- Anyone who regularly deals with text lists  

Basically: **if your job involves lists, SortList is for you.**
